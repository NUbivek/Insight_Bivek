Thank you for reviewing my application.

***IMPORTANT NOTE:***
Please, review my final output (in attached four .txt files). I was able to get the desired output for each of the four questions. However, when I tested the output in terminal, I got "FAIL" for all four files -- even when I used the sample output for "hours" file. I have a reasonable amount of confidence on my codes, and I believe the output is correct. Please, consider reviewing my codes and the final output manually as opposed to relying on the test platform. I appreciate your kind consideration.
